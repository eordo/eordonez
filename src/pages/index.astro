		<p>I'm a data science student with a background in economics and statistics. I use tools from econometrics, machine learning, and simulation to connect city design to social outcomes.</p>
		<p>My research is rooted in two core questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How do urban systems like education, housing, and transit shape family well-being and intergenerational outcomes?</li>
			<li>How do these dynamics differ across cities and countries?</li>
		</ul>
