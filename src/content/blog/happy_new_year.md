_Adieu, 2025._
I thought about starting this blog with a reflection of the past year’s trials and triumphs.
But with a 3-year-old and 1-year-old at home, I can hardly remember what I did last week, let alone last year.
(I wonder if this part of parenthood ever gets better…)

Instead, I thought about the things that I want to remember when I reflect again in one year's time.
Here is what I’m most looking forward to in 2026:

- Bringing my daughter to the Philippines for the first time
- Seeing the World Cup in Boston and Toronto
- Celebrating America’s 250th in Boston
- Attending my brother’s wedding in Chicago
- Finishing my master’s in data science at Harvard

Have a blessed new year, everyone.
_À 2026 !_
